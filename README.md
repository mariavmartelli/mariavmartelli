## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me

I'm Maria Vitória Martelli — a student of **Information Technology** at **FAETERJ Petrópolis** and a current **Software/TIC resident** at [Serratec](https://serratec.org).  
I'm interested in **software development** and **cybersecurity**, especially as tools for real social transformation.

I believe technology should be empathetic, purposeful, and accessible. I'm passionate about learning, building secure and meaningful solutions, and contributing to projects that serve **those who need it most** — especially those focused on **collective well-being**, public interest, and social justice.  
I also defend **free and shared knowledge**, collaboration, and code that solves real problems with social impact.
